# RFD_Concept_Drift_Detection
Supplemental material for the paper "A metadata-driven approach for concept drift detection in Machine Learning Systems"

This repository contains the datasets used for experimental evaluation, as well as some utilities for generating test configurations. In addition, scripts are provided for using the data drift methods of the FROUROS library. In particular, code is provided for the Hellinger distance and HiNormalizedComplement, but the scripts are easily adaptable for the other methods provided by the library. Finally, there are also files containing the complete results for each experiment performed, including the metrics excluded in the paper for reasons of space.
